# Userscripts
Browser Userscripts I use (almost) every day

## AutoGrader
_Expedites the grading process by automatically filling in the maximum point values for text inputs and checking all checkboxes._

**WARNING:** This script is to be used for educational purposes only.

## Nitter Tweaks
_UI Tweaks to clean up Nitter_

Makes Twitter / Nitter actually usable without an account.
Endless hours of time wasted watching other people argue online.

## Quizlet
_View Quizlets in a clean table, easily searchible_

Made this so I could easily search quizlets for... uh... *studying*.
